## Credits and notes

The tile layout is based around an user editable xml, which is stored in your User folder, in the DirectStart folder.
Documentation for various settings coming soon.

Notes: 
- If you are building the application manually, you need to put the contents of the "ConfigurationTemplate" folder in the repository into your user folder.
- To "pin" items to the start menu, please put them in the "C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu"
